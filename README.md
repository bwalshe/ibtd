# I Beg to Differ
A basic vector autodiff implementation I made to help me understand the field a bit better.

This is still a bit basic at the moment. In `examples/linear.py` you can find a script that will calculate the gradients for `W * x + b`.

It should be easy enough to expand it to do more, if I ever get around to doing that.
