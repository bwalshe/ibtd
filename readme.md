# I Beg to Differ
A basic vector autodiff implementation I made to help me understand the field a bit better.

Right now you can just run `ibtd/operations.py` as a script and it will calculate the gradients for 
`W * x + b`, but that is about all.

It should be easy enough to expand it to do more, if I ever get around to doing that.
